# ParAcT-DDM: A diffusion-based framework for modelling systematic, time-varying cognitive processes. 

All of the code and data for the project ParAcT-DDM: A diffusion-based framework for modelling systematic, time-varying cognitive processes. 
The main code relevent for applying this code to a new project is in "Modelling" which contains the scripts where time-varying functions, models  are defined, 
as well as the fitting script. The "Recovery" folder containst he code for both 1. simulating time-varying data sets based on a ParAcT model, as well as fitting
models to that data set. Each of these folders also have their own `readme` files with more information.
